<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>There is no consensus on how to best analyze responses to single Likert items. Therefore, studies involving Likert-type responses can be perceived as untrustworthy by researchers who disagree with the particular statistical analysis method used. We report a multiverse reanalysis of such a study, consisting of nine different statistical analyses. The conclusions are consistent with the previously reported findings, and are remarkably robust to the choice of statistical analysis.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 2014, Tal and Wansink <dt-cite key="tal2016blinded"></dt-cite> published a study entitled "Blinded with science: Trivial graphs and formulas increase ad persuasiveness and belief in product efficacy" in the journal Public Understanding
of Science. The study shows that adding a chart to a statement about a new drug increases people's belief in the drug's efficacy. However, a 2016 replication by Dragicevic and Jansen <dt-cite key="dragicevic2018blinded"></dt-cite> suggests that the effect may not be as robust as claimed: in a series of four replications conducted on two crowdsourcing platforms, the chart appeared to be no more persuasive – and sometimes less persuasive – than text alone.</p>

<p>However, these results are based on Likert-type responses, which are known to be tricky to analyze, as there is currently no consensus on how to best analyze this type of data. Tal and Wansink <dt-cite key="tal2016blinded"></dt-cite> used simple <i>t</i>-tests, while Dragicevic and Jansen <dt-cite key="dragicevic2018blinded"></dt-cite> used bootstrap confidence intervals in order to gain more robustness against possible departures from the normality assumption. However, there are many other ways the same data could have been analyzed. Here we report on nine different ways of analyzing the data. All these methods lead to the same conclusions, confirming that the findings are robust to the choice of statistical analysis.</p>

<p>Our reporting approach which combines the principle of multiverse analysis <dt-cite key="steegen2016increasing"></dt-cite> with the idea of explorable explanation <dt-cite key="Victor2011"></dt-cite> can be used not only in reanalyses but also in original studies in order to make findings results more reliable and more convincing when there is a disagreement about the best statistical  analysis method.</p>

<h2>Dataset and Questions</h2>

<p>Dragicevic and Jansen's <dt-cite key="dragicevic2018blinded"></dt-cite> study has four experiments. In each experiment, each participant is either shown a text about a hypothetical drug ("no_graph" condition) or the same text with a chart ("graph" condition). The participant is then asked to assess to what extent the drug is effective, on a scale from 1 to 7. We focus on this data here. The study has another important dependent variable (error of the response to a comprehension question) but it is not Likert-type data and therefore not addressed here.</p>

</figure>

<p>Figure 1 shows the distribution of the raw data. Our question is whether there is an overall difference between graph and no_graph, for each of the four experiments (e1 to e4). We answer this question using nine different statistical analyses, whose results are summarized in the next section.</p>

<h2>Summary of Results</h2>

<p>Seven of the nine methods provide us with a point estimate and a 95% interval estimate of the average difference between the two conditions, all summarized in Figure 2. The remaining two procedures provide estimates as a log-odds ratio, shown in Figure 3 (for beta regression, this is the log of the ratio of the odds of going from one extreme of the scale to the other between the two conditions; for ordinal regression, this is the log of the ratio of the odds of going from one category on the scale to any category above it between the two conditions; 0 indicates equal odds). On both figures, red intervals are statistically significant at the .05 level, while blue intervals are non-significant.</p>

<h2>Analysis Details</h2>

<!-- FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE ANALYSIS: DESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE METHOD -->

<p>

<span data-var="ttest" class="TKSwitch"><span></span><span>
Tal and Wansink <dt-cite key="tal2016blinded"></dt-cite> used a <b>t-test</b> to analyze their own data. For this method, we compute the difference between the two means, its 95% <i>t</i>-based confidence interval for independent samples and the corresponding <i>p</i>-value for a null hypothesis of no effect.
This method assumes normal sampling distributions, which is reasonable here given that the data is bell-shaped and sample sizes range between <i>N</i>=60 and <i>N</i>=90 per condition.
</span></span>

<span data-var="bootstrap" class="TKSwitch"><span></span><span>
Dragicevic and Jansen <dt-cite key="dragicevic2018blinded"></dt-cite> analyzed their data using the <b>bootstrap</b> method. With this method, we compute the 95% BCa non-parametric bootstrap confidence interval for the difference between two means. Bootstrapping has been shown to work with a range of exotic data distributions but can give liberal interval estimates when the sample size is small <dt-cite key="kirby2013bootes"></dt-cite> (i.e., <i>N</i> ≤ 10, which is not the case here since sample sizes range between <i>N</i>=60 and <i>N</i>=90 per condition). This method does not provide a <i>p</i>-value.
</span></span>

<span data-var="wilcoxon" class="TKSwitch"><span></span><span>
For the <b>wilcoxon</b> method, we use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test and compute the corresponding p-value for a null hypothesis of no effect.
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric method commonly recommended as an alternative to the <i>t</i>-test when there are reasons to doubt the normality assumption. The estimate (and its 95% CI) are for the median of the difference between samples (not the difference in the medians).
</span></span>

<span data-var="betaregression" class="TKSwitch"><span></span><span>
For the <b>beta regression</b> method, we perform a maximum-likelihood regression with a beta-distributed dependent variable.
This method has been recommended for analyzing scales with a lower and upper bound and is robust to skew and heteroscedasticity <dt-cite key="kirby2013bootes"></dt-cite>. We rescaled the data to be in (0, 1) by dividing all responses by 10. We report the log odds ratio between conditions: the log of the ratio of the odds of going from one extreme of the scale to the other.
</span></span>

<span data-var="betaregbayes" class="TKSwitch"><span></span><span>
For the <b>beta reg (Bayes)</b> method, we use a Bayesian formulation of beta regression.
This method has been recommended for analyzing scales with a lower and upper bound and is robust to skew and heteroscedasticity <dt-cite key="kirby2013bootes"></dt-cite>. We rescaled the data to be in (0, 1) by dividing all responses by 10. We fit a beta regression within each experiment, using weakly informative priors.
We report estimates of marginal means on the original scale.
</span></span>

<span data-var="ordinalreg" class="TKSwitch"><span></span><span>
For the <b>ordinal reg</b> method, we use an ordinal logistic regression <dt-cite key="mcelreath2018statistical"></dt-cite>.
Ordinal models are often applied to Likert-type data. We report the log odds ratio between conditions: 
the log of the ratio of the odds of going from one category on the scale to any category above it.
</span></span>

<span data-var="ordinalregbayes" class="TKSwitch"><span></span><span>
For the <b>ordinal reg (Bayes)</b> method, we use a Bayesian ordinal logistic regression <dt-cite key="mcelreath2018statistical"></dt-cite>.
Ordinal models are often applied to Likert-type data. We report estimates of marginal means on the original scale.
</span></span>

<span data-var="robust" class="TKSwitch"><span></span><span>
For the <b>robust</b> method, we perform a robust, heteroskedastic linear regression: we use a Student <i>t</i> error distribution instead of Gaussian error distribution, and estimate a different variance parameter for each group.
This is essentially Kruschke's <dt-cite key="kruschke2013bayesian"></dt-cite> BEST test (a Bayesian, robust, hetereoskedastic alternative to the <i>t</i>-test), but estimated using a frequentist procedure instead of a Bayesian one.
</span></span>

<span data-var="truncated" class="TKSwitch"><span></span><span>
For the <b>truncated</b> method, we perform a truncated normal regression model. This model also accounts for hetereoskedasticity (non-constant variance) by estimating a different variance parameter for each condition.
</span></span>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>However we analyze the data, the substantive conclusions are about the same. While the Wilcoxon estimates and intervals in Figure 1 look different from the other estimates, it is estimating a slightly different quantity: a median of the differences instead of a difference in means (as the other approaches in Figure 2 are). In Figure 3, while the two rows are both on the log odds scale, they are measuring log odds ratios of different things, so it is hard to compare the values directly. Since the ordinal regression measures the log odds ratio of an increase from one category to any category above it, we should expect this value to be larger than the estimate from the beta regression, which measures the log odds ratio of going from one extreme of the scale to the other (a less likely event). With smaller sample sizes, it is likely that the results would have differed more.</p>

<p>From this multiverse analysis, we can conclude that our results are very robust, and not strongly sensitive to the choice of analysis method: if the conclusions of Dragicevic and Jansen <dt-cite key="dragicevic2018blinded"></dt-cite> were to be wrong, it is very unlikely that the cause would be in the choice of statistical analysis.</p>

<p>Our reporting approach, which combines the principle of multiverse analysis <dt-cite key="steegen2016increasing"></dt-cite> with the idea of explorable explanation <dt-cite key="Victor2011"></dt-cite>, can be used not only in reanalyses but also in original studies in order to make statistical results more convincing when there is no consensus as to what method is best to analyze such data.</p>
